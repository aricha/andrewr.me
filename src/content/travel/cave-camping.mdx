The Phong Nha region of Vietnam is home to many of the largest caves in the world, including both the world's largest, Son Doong, and the third largest, Hang En. While I wasn't able to visit Son Doong (it's a complicated and expensive ordeal), I did have the opportunity to visit Hang En as part of a 2-day hiking expedition, including an overnight stay camping in the cave itself. The scale of Hang En is mind-blowing, spanning up to 145 meters tall and nearly 2 kilometers deep. Incredibly, during the rainy season the cave can fill nearly 100 meters deep with rainfall!

Camping in a cave this massive is a surreal experience. The company I traveled with, Oxalis, had a campsite set up for us in the middle of the cave, complete with eco outhouses and a water station, to make the experience surprisingly comfortable. They took us hiking to explore the depths of the cave, giving us a better sense of its sheer scale and a chance to view beautiful stalagmites and other formations.

The trek to get there and back was beautiful in its own right, with towering limestone karsts and lush jungle surrounding us as we made our way to the cave.

Visiting Hang En was a unique and unforgettable experience. Phong Nha is home to literally hundreds of caves, but this is certainly one of the coolest caves to visit anywhere.
